# Equilibre

Equilibre is a solution focused on reliability. It helps you set goals and set automated remediation and our engine will automatically try to converge and make things go back to normal.

# Metrics

We use standard terminology within this project:

- SLI: Service level indicators
- SLO: Service level objectives
- SLA: Service level agreement

You will mostly see SLI and SLO being heavily used as we consider SLA to be mostly a legal matter.

# Features

Astroid provides features like:

- SLI/SLO management and tracking.
- SLO optimization.
- Automated remediation.
- Simplified developer on-boarding.
- Federation (centralise your Equilibre by federating multiple clusters)
- UI (delivered as a micro-frontend)
